# Mini-Project-Salary-Survey-EntriApp
A Comprehensive Salary Breakdown by Demographic and Career Factors

Project Objective:

To conduct a comprehensive and objective analysis of salary variations, based on the following factors:

•	Demographics (gender, race/ethnicity)

•	Highest level of educational attainment

•	Overall work experience

•	Experience in a related field

Tools used:

•	Excel

•	Power BI


Conclusion:
A comprehensive analysis of salary data reveals significant variations based on several key factors. Educational attainment is strongly correlated with higher earnings, with advanced degrees leading to substantially increased earning potential. Work experience, both overall and within a specific field, also plays a crucial role in salary progression. However, persistent disparities exist across demographic groups. The gender pay gap continues to be a concern, with women generally earning less than men. Racial and ethnic disparities are also evident, with some groups consistently earning less than others. These findings highlight the complex interplay of factors that influence salary levels and underscore the need for continued research and efforts to promote equitable compensation practices.
